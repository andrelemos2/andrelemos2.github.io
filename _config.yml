additionalinfo: |
   <strong>JVM</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have recently worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate), GWT in addition to others.  In my current role Java is the primary language used - and I am familiar with many of the languages features and quirks. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Web Development</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on the Spring MVC framework (although current role uses ColdFusion for server side web stack). I have also worked with some client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone/Underscore/Require.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven and Jenkins. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/Parse. <br/><br/>
